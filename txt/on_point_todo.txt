make everything more feminine

Add social media links to the front with feminine icons

Change the color scheme
Change the fonts on the home page to be more feminine

Change all the text
Because it shows that you've used a template

add more pictures

If you have to, delete some things to simplify it for now
And then add it back later if needed
