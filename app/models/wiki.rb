Historical materialist analysis, outlining revolutions in technology with their corresponding revolutions in society

The rise of neo-fascism and how to resist it, explain it's emergence as a result of late capitalism's failure to prevent further crises and maintain civility/order

The necessity of addressing newer aspects of an evolved fascism, such as embracing rampant individualism and unbridled capitalism over nationalism, or even simple racism

The inevitable, global revolution, cyber-warfare, psychological warfare, control of information, out right violence becoming unnecessary to subvert the corporate elite, how exactly to subvert capitalism through non-violent means

Philosophical concepts underpinning vaporwave and it's inherently subversive nature

The fundamentally subversive nature of memes and free software as ultimate commodities, how they constitute the begginings of a radically new and different mode of production by transcending traditional rules and forces of the market, partly by rendering the means of production once again decentralized and distritubed

Post-capitalism, artificial intelligence, space exploration, criticisms of capitalism, how to build past capitalism, the greater depth and dimensions added to culture and human emotion by artificial intelligence

Model of consensus voting as primary mode of organisation in post-capitalist society

Independent communes/regions and how they'll federate into larger networks to pool enough resources to begin space travel and solving the greatest mysteries of physics

Building a DIY global Internet, independent of any state or corporate entity, by, for, and of the people. Necessary to successfully wage global revolution and end late stage capitalism

Existential philosophy and how to overcome the absence of god and then past individualism as the end all be all to human philosophical development, how to establish a more inclusive humanism
