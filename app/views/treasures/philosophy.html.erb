    <b id="foucault">Michel Foucault</b> - Theories primarily address the relationship between power and knowledge, and how they are used as a form of social control through societal institutions. Though often cited as a post-structuralist and postmodernist, Foucault rejected these labels, preferring to present his thought as a critical history of modernity.

  <p class="justified_body_text">
    <b id="derrida">Jacques Derrida</b> - French philosopher best known for developing a form of semiotic analysis known as deconstruction, which he discussed in numerous texts, and developed in the context of phenomenology. He is one of the major figures associated with post-structuralism and hermeneutics.
  </p>
  <p class="justified_body_text">
    Deconstruction was a critique of the relationship between text and meaning, consisting in conducting readings of texts with an ear to what runs counter to the structural unity or intended sense of a particular text. The purpose is to expose that the object of language, and that which any text is founded upon, is irreducibly complex, unstable, or impossible.

    <b id="heidegger">Martin Heidegger</b> - German philosopher and a seminal thinker in the Continental tradition and philosophical hermeneutics, best known for his contributions to phenomenology and existentialism.

  <p class="justified_body_text">
    <b id="husserl">Edmund Husserl</b> - German philosopher who established the school of phenomenology. Husserl made some key conceptual elaborations which led him to assert that in order to study the structure of consciousness, one would have to distinguish between the act of consciousness and the phenomena at which it is directed (the objects as intended). Knowledge of essences would only be possible by bracketing, or suspending all judgment about the natural world to instead focus on analysis of experience. This procedure he called epoché.

  <p class="justified_body_text">
    <b id="lacan">Jacques Lacan</b> - France’s most famous psychoanalyst, who came up with the intriguing concept of the ‘mirror phase.’
  </p>
  <p class="justified_body_text">
    The mirror stage is based on the belief that infants recognize themselves in a mirror (literal) or other symbolic contraption which induces apperception (the turning of oneself into an object that can be viewed by the child from outside themselves) from the age of about six months.

  <p class="justified_body_text">
    <b id="jung">Carl Jung</b> -  Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who founded analytical psychology and collaborated with  Sigmund Freud.
  </p>
  <p class="justified_body_text">
    Among the central concepts of analytical psychology is individuation—the lifelong psychological process of differentiation of the self out of each individual's conscious and unconscious elements. Jung considered it to be the main task of human development.

  <p>
    <b id="phenomenology">Phenomenology</b> - The philosophical study of the structures of experience and consciousness.
  </p>
  <p class="justified_body_text">
    A unique and final definition of phenomenology is dangerous and perhaps even paradoxical as it lacks a thematic focus. In fact, it is not a doctrine, nor a philosophical school, but rather a style of thought, a method, an open and ever-renewed experience having different results, and this may disorient anyone wishing to define the meaning of phenomenology.
  </p>
  <p>
    That knowledge could be centred on the human knower.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="dark_card" align="center">
  <p class="justified_body_text">
    <b id="post_structuralism">Post-structuralism</b> - That founding knowledge either on pure experience (phenomenology) or systematic structures (Structuralism) is impossible. This impossibility is not meant as a failure or loss, but rather as a cause for "celebration and liberation."
  </p>
  <p class="justified_body_text">
    A major theory associated with Structuralism was binary opposition. This theory proposed that there are certain theoretical and conceptual opposites, often arranged in a hierarchy. Post-structuralism rejects the notion of the essential quality of the dominant relation in the hierarchy, choosing rather to expose these relations and the dependency of the dominant term on its apparently subservient counterpart.

<div class="dark_card" align="center">
  <p>
    <b id="hermeneutics">Hermeneutics</b> - The theory and methodology of interpretation, especially the interpretation of biblical texts, wisdom literature, and philosophical texts.

<div class="dark_card" align="center">
  <p>
    <b id="psychoanalysis">Psychoanalysis</b> - A set of theories and therapeutic techniques related to the study of the unconscious mind, which together form a method of treatment for mental-health disorders.
  </p>
  <p class="justified_body_text">
    That people can be cured by making conscious their unconscious thoughts and motivations. Psychoanalytic psychologists see psychological problems as rooted in the unconscious mind. Manifest symptoms are caused by latent (hidden) disturbances. Typical causes include unresolved issues during development or repressed trauma. Treatment focuses on bringing the repressed conflict to consciousness.
