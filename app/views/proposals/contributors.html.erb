      In Poland, a developer by the name of <%= link_to "Marek Marecki (GitHub)", marekjm_path %> helped to clean up the project's repository by deleting hidden duplicate files that had been generated while developing Anrcho on OSX (never again) and even <%= link_to "updated .gitignore", marekjm_pr_path %> to prevent the issue from ever happening again.

    There is now an IRC channel set up on Freenode as #anrcho, thanks to <%= link_to "Rudolf Olah", omouse_path %>, a Canadian developer who also <%= link_to "wrote instructions", omouse_pr_path %> for setting up the test server. There's even a cloud based IDE on Cloud9 enabling anyone to begin working on Anrcho in collaboration with others, per their advice, among various other proposals which have helped the project greatly.
